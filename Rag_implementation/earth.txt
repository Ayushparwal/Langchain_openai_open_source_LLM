Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is a remarkable celestial body teeming with life. Unique in our solar system, it is often called the "Blue Planet" due to the abundant water covering about 71% of its surface. Earth’s complex system of land, water, air, and life has allowed for the development of a rich biosphere, making it distinct from other planets.

The planet is about 4.5 billion years old and has a layered structure, consisting of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The crust is Earth's outermost layer, where we live, and it’s broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates move slowly but are responsible for many geological phenomena like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains. Below the crust lies the mantle, a thick layer of semi-molten rock, which drives plate tectonics through convection currents. At the core, primarily composed of iron and nickel, Earth's inner and outer cores generate a magnetic field that protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays.

Water plays a vital role in shaping the planet's surface and sustaining life. Earth's oceans, rivers, lakes, and glaciers are part of the hydrosphere, a system that regulates the climate and supports ecosystems. The water cycle—where water evaporates, condenses into clouds, and falls as precipitation—constantly renews the planet’s freshwater sources.
